OVERVIEW:

PROJECT:DESIGN FSM USING VERILOG AND WRITING TESTBENCHES.

KEY ACTIVITIES: FSM Design:The FSM has three states: RED, GREEN, and YELLOW.It transitions from RED to GREEN, GREEN to YELLOW, and YELLOW to RED in a cyclic manner.The light output is determined based on the current state.

Testbench:The testbench generates a clock signal and initializes the reset signal.It observes the state transitions and prints the output light state at each time step.
